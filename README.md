The aim of this project is to evaluate the financial well-being 
and creditworthiness of companies using the balance sheets of 
the respective companies and to identify potential cases of 
default. 


Building a predictive model will help the 
organization anticipate potential challenges with the financial 
performance of the companies and enable proactive risk 
mitigation strategies.
